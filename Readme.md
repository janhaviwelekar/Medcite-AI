## 📌 What is MedCite AI?

MedCite AI is an AI-powered semantic intelligence platform that evaluates how effectively medical research content can be retrieved, understood, and cited by AI systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude.

Most medical content is written for human readers — not optimized for semantic retrieval, generative search, or LLM summarization. As a result:

- Important studies may not surface in AI-powered search
- Vague conclusions increase the risk of AI hallucination
- Clinical findings become difficult for LLMs to interpret correctly

MedCite AI bridges this gap by combining **GEO**, **AEO**, biomedical NLP, and semantic embeddings into a single, practical dashboard.

---

## 💡 Why This Idea?

Modern AI systems increasingly influence healthcare search, scientific discovery, and clinical information retrieval. Yet very few tools exist to help optimize medical research specifically for AI discoverability.

MedCite AI explores an emerging category: **AI-native scientific content optimization** — helping researchers and clinicians understand how AI systems interpret their work, and where that interpretation may break down.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Medical AEO Score** — Measures answer extraction quality, direct response clarity, and FAQ-style answerability for AI assistants
- **GEO Score** — Evaluates semantic richness, retrievability, contextual completeness, and embedding consistency for generative AI systems
- **AI Citation Probability** — Predicts likelihood of ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini citing or using the content in generated answers
- **Biomedical Entity Recognition** — Detects diseases, drugs, biomarkers, treatments, patient populations, and outcomes using HuggingFace NER models
- **Hallucination Risk Detection** — Identifies vague claims, unsupported conclusions, and ambiguous wording (e.g. "may suggest", "possibly associated")
- **Semantic Clarity Analysis** — Measures chunk independence, scientific readability, and contextual completeness for RAG pipelines
- **AI Summary Simulation** — Generates AI-style summaries, retrieval previews, and LLM-like response previews
- **Retrieval Heatmap** — Visualizes semantically important sections and retrieval-dense sentences

## 🤖 Hugging Face Models Used

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Semantic similarity, GEO scoring, retrieval analysis |
| `facebook/bart-large-cnn` | AI summary generation and retrieval previews |
| `facebook/bart-large-mnli` | Zero-shot classification, hallucination detection, scientific confidence analysis |
| `d4data/biomedical-ner-all` | Biomedical named entity recognition (diseases, drugs, treatments, biomarkers) |

All models run on CPU — no GPU required.
